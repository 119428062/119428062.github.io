	I have played soccer since the age of 8. My favourite team is Manchester United and my favourite player is Marcus Rashford. I also play soccer with Bandon.<br>

	<ol>TRAVEL</ol>
	<p>
	I enjoy to travel a lot. My favourite place to travel is undoubtedly Spain for its hot climate.<br>
	I recently went to Santa Ponsa with my friends on a leaving cert holiday and I will go to Albufeira with my friends this summer for a week.<br>
	A destination that I would love to go to is Santorini in Greece as I have seen quite picturesque photos of the place on social media sites such as Facebook
