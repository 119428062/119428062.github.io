   <body style="background-color:#99ccff;">
   As defined by Gartner, hyper-automation “deals with the application of advanced technologies,<br/>
   including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to increasingly automate processes and augment humans.<br/>
   Hyper-automation extends across a range of tools that can be automated,<br/>
   but also refers to the sophistication of the automation (i.e., discover, analyse, design, automate, measure, monitor, reassess.)”<br/> 
   In simple terms, hyper-automation refers to the mixture of automation technologies that exist to augment and expand human capabilities. <br/>

<body style="background-color:#99ccff;">
Multiexperience is a concept pioneered by Gartner late in 2019. The concept is being championed as one of the biggest developments for 2020.<br/> 
In fact, Gartner states that “more than 25% of the  mobile apps, progressive web apps<br/>
 and conversational apps at large enterprises will be built and/or run through a multiexperience development platform” by 2023.<br/>
 In short, multiexperience is about adapting to the increasing market of different devices and their respective experiences. <br/>

 <h2>Distributed Cloud</h2>
 <p style="font-size:100%;">
<body style="background-color:#99ccff;">
Distributed cloud is the application of cloud computing technologies to interconnect data and applications served from multiple geographic locations.<br/>
Distributed, in an information technology (IT) context, means that something is shared among multiple systems which may also be in different locations.<br/>
Distributed cloud speeds communications for global services and enables more responsive communications for specific regions.<br/>
